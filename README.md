# Brent Oil Change Point Analysis – Birhan Energies

Bayesian change point detection on historical Brent crude oil prices (1987–2022) to identify structural breaks and associate them with major geopolitical, economic, and OPEC events.

## Project Goals

- Detect change points using PyMC Bayesian modeling
- Link breaks to key events (2014–2022 focus)
- Quantify impacts (mean shifts, % changes)
- Build interactive dashboard for stakeholders
